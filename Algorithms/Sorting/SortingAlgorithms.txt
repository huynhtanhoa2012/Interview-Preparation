SELECTION and INSERTION SORT
During the selection sort algorithm, the array or list is divided into two parts: 
+ the sorted part at the left end 
+ the unsorted part at the right end. 

Solution SELECTION:
# Loop entire array to n-2
    # Variable to store index of minimum value in array
    # Run nested loop through the rest of array to find minimum value
        # Store index of minimum value  
    # Swap the element at indexMin and i

Solution INSERTION:
# Loop array from 1 to n-1
    # Create a variable to store value of arr[i]
    # Create a varibale to store hole
    # Chekc if hole > 0 and arr[hole-1] > value
        # arr[hole] = arr[hole-1]
        # hole = hole - 1
    # arr[hole] = value
